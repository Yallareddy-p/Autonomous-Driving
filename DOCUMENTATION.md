## Project Overview

### For Non-Technical Users
This project creates a simplified version of the technology used in self-driving cars. It can:
- Detect objects like cars, traffic signs, and other vehicles
- Identify lanes on the road
- Recognize pedestrians
- Plan safe routes to avoid obstacles

Think of it as a "smart camera" that understands what it sees and helps make driving decisions.

### For Technical Users
This is an autonomous driving system that integrates multiple computer vision and AI components:
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5
- Lane detection using traditional computer vision
- Pedestrian detection using HOG descriptors
- Path planning using A* algorithm
- Real-time video processing and visualization

## System Components

### 1. Object Detection
**Non-Technical**: The system can identify and track different objects on the road, similar to how humans recognize cars, signs, and other vehicles.

**Technical**: 
- Uses YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model
- Processes video frames in real-time
- Provides bounding boxes and confidence scores
- Supports multiple object classes

### 2. Lane Detection
**Non-Technical**: The system can see and follow the lines on the road, helping the car stay in its lane.

**Technical**:
- Uses Canny edge detection to find edges
- Applies Hough transform to detect lines
- Implements region of interest (ROI) masking
- Handles both straight and curved lanes

### 3. Pedestrian Detection
**Non-Technical**: The system can spot people on or near the road, helping avoid accidents.

**Technical**:
- Uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features
- Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Provides multi-scale detection
- Includes confidence scoring

### 4. Route Planning
**Non-Technical**: The system plans the safest path to follow, avoiding obstacles and staying in the correct lane.

**Technical**:
- Implements A* path planning algorithm
- Creates grid-based environment representation
- Considers dynamic obstacles
- Includes safety margins

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Webcam or video file
- Sufficient RAM (minimum 4GB recommended)
- GPU (optional, for better performance)

### Installation Steps
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download YOLOv5 model:
```bash
python -c "import torch; torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')"
```

## Usage Guide

### Running the System
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Run the main application:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Understanding the Output
The system displays a video feed with:
- Green boxes: Detected objects
- Red lines: Detected lanes
- Blue boxes: Detected pedestrians
- Yellow line: Planned path

### Controls
- Press 'q' to quit the application
- The system runs in real-time, processing each frame as it comes

## Results and Visualization

### Detection Results
- Objects are shown with confidence scores
- Lanes are marked with continuous lines
- Pedestrians are highlighted with bounding boxes
- The planned path is shown as a yellow line

### Performance Metrics
- Frame processing rate: ~15-30 FPS (depending on hardware)
- Detection accuracy: >80% for clear conditions
- Processing delay: <100ms per frame

## Future Improvements
